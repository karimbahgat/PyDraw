To do list:

- Make scanline fill do antialiased as well
- Also make it support selfintersecting polygons...

- For lines implement line fill algorithm by drawing rectangles instead of points, http://www.tophatstuff.co.uk/archive.php?p=106
- For polygons implement scanline fill algorithm, http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/02/jill/graphics/hw3/hw3.html
- For circles implement circle fill, http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/02/jill/graphics/hw3/hw3.html

- Maybe after this, contribute some of this into the PNGCANVAS project, https://github.com/rcarmo/pngcanvas
